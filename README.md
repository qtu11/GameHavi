## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

### Additional Notes:
- I checked the live demo link<a href="https://qtu11.github.io/GameHavi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a>, but without access to the actual site or repository, I can’t verify if it’s functional or matches the description. If you’d like me to analyze the live site or specific files, please provide more details or upload relevant content.
- If you want me to generate a chart or visual (e.g., to showcase website responsiveness across devices), let me know the specific data or metrics you’d like to display.

Let me know if you need help refining this further or analyzing specific parts of the project!
